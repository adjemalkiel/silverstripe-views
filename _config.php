/* The silverstripe-views module provides a way for UI (theme) designers and
 * content organizers to define dynamic "views", or queries into the content
 * system, to utilize in their templates.  These views can then power any
 * number of interface features and widgets without a developer needing to
 * write custom query functions that can be called from the SilverStripe
 * templates (in control tags).
 *
 * This config file currently contains no configuration, but must exist for
 * SilverStripe to recognize this folder as a module.
